# Test ocore upgrade to v4

v4 includes OIPs 3-8 https://github.com/byteball/OIPs.

## Install
```bash
yarn
```
(it it important to use yarn, not npm, to take advantage of the `resolutions` field in package.json that pulls [ocore#v4](https://github.com/byteball/ocore/tree/v4)).

## Run tests

```bash
yarn test
```
